## Data Sources and Project Ideas

1. Statistical Analysis of the English Premier League Dataset
   * [EPL Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/premier-league-matches-19922022)
   * Some things we could do with this dataset include an exploration of the home field advantage, the impact of previous success/failure on future success/failure, and we could also create a new dataset with information pertaining to managers to examine the effectiveness of changing coaches.
  
2. National Football League statistics
   * [NFL Data](https://www.footballdb.com/seasons/index.html)
   * A continutation of the EPL data, I would be interested in the coaching hires of the NFL, examining the effect of changing coaches on future success of the organization, with the overarching question, "Is it worth it to fire your coach?". We could answer this question by creating a database containing all NFL seasons in which the team fired their coach afterwards or beforehand, and examine their win total the next year compared to last. We could also look at 2 year and 3 year intervals to examine a longer term impact as well as examine statistics like points for and against and league-wide offensive and defensive rankings.
  
3. College Tuition Rates/Majors and future earnings
   * [College Tuition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay)
   * [Salaries by Major](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wsj/college-salaries)
   * We could combine these two datasets to create a dataset which could be analyzed in a myriad of different ways. I think it would be interesting to examine which majors are worth it to get a degree in by how much money you make after graduation compared to how much you pay to attend your college. There's bound to be some majors that have a negative ROI and some that have a positive ROI. It also likely depends on the school you attend. We could hypothetically choose the school that nets the highest return on investment.

4. National Park Species Dataset
   * [Parks and Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity?resource=download&select=parks.csv)
   * There are two datasets contained within this kaggle file, one of the national park information and one of the species information contained within each park. We could merge the data frames and examine species trends by size of park and/or location. There are numerous possibilities of analysis with these two datasets merged.

5. Census Data
   * [Dataset Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data)
   * The census data has endless possibilities for analysis. If I were to try to do some sort of exploration with this data, I would want to look at demographic changes state to state, as that seems to be a large topic of conversation in the political sphere these days. 

## Where's Schueller? 

This is a visualization of my in class Intro to Data Science Project about day-to-day the whereabouts of our professor, Albert Schueller. My partner and I decided to examine the grocery store visitation frequency of Professor Schueller for various grocery stores in town.
